# LearningSwiftUI_WeSplit
Teaching myself SwiftUI by following the "100 Days of SwiftUI" program. 
Project 1 found here: https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/16

WeSplit is a simple app that makes group dining easier. The app allows users to input a bill amount, select the number of people, select a tip amount from a few common preset options, and then the program displays the total and per person cost.
